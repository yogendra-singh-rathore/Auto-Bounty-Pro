## About Auto Bounty Pro

Auto Bounty Pro is an open-source, customizable, and robust automation tool designed to streamline the bug bounty hunting process. Built with flexibility and extensibility in mind, it allows security researchers and penetration testers to efficiently manage and automate various stages of their security assessments.

### Key Features

- **Customizable Tool Integration**: Easily add or remove tools based on your specific requirements, categorize them, and integrate them into your workflow.
- **Robust Project Management**: Each project is self-contained, with its own scan outputs, input data, and reports, allowing for organized and efficient project handling.
- **Automation and Pipelines**: Automate repetitive tasks and create pipelines where the output of one tool can be used as the input for another, streamlining your workflow.
- **Local and Remote Access**: While primarily designed to run on a local machine, Auto Bounty Pro also supports remote access via a web interface, providing flexibility in how you work.
- **Integration with OWASP ZAP & Burp Suite**: Enhance your web application security testing with seamless integration with these powerful tools.
- **Wordlist Management**: Manage and use wordlists efficiently by installing them directly into the toolâ€™s database.
- **Scripting and Cron Jobs**: Upload and run custom scripts (Python, Bash) and set up cron jobs for scheduled tasks to further enhance the tool's capabilities.
- **Server and API**: The tool can run its own server to provide a basic web app with a good user interface and RESTful API endpoints for interacting with other tools and systems.

### Mission

Our mission is to empower security researchers and penetration testers with a tool that not only simplifies and automates the bug bounty process but also adapts to their unique workflows and needs. By providing a flexible and robust platform, we aim to enhance productivity and efficiency in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.
