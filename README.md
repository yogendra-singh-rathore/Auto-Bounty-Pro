- **Robust Project Management**: Each project is self-contained, with its own scan outputs, input data, and reports, allowing for organized and efficient project handling.
- **Automation and Pipelines**: Automate repetitive tasks and create pipelines where the output of one tool can be used as the input for another, streamlining your workflow.
- **Local and Remote Access**: While primarily designed to run on a local machine, Auto Bounty Pro also supports remote access via a web interface, providing flexibility in how you work.
- **Integration with OWASP ZAP & Burp Suite**: Enhance your web application security testing with seamless integration with these powerful tools.
- **Wordlist Management**: Manage and use wordlists efficiently by installing them directly into the toolâ€™s database.
- **Scripting and Cron Jobs**: Upload and run custom scripts (Python, Bash) and set up cron jobs for scheduled tasks to further enhance the tool's capabilities.
- **Server and API**: The tool can run its own server to provide a basic web app with a good user interface and RESTful API endpoints for interacting with other tools and systems.

### Mission

Our mission is to empower security researchers and penetration testers with a tool that not only simplifies and automates the bug bounty process but also adapts to their unique workflows and needs. By providing a flexible and robust platform, we aim to enhance productivity and efficiency in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.
